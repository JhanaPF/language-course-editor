# Course editor

This project is a fork of [Dictionnaire_Participatif](https://github.com/JhanaPF/Dictionnaire_Participatif), a collaborative dictionary.

The dashboard is the course creator.
The api works for both the dashboard and the mobile app.

You can find the mobile app Linguito Lerni [here](https://github.com/JhanaPF/linguito-lerni-flutter).

## üê≥ Running the App with Docker Compose

This project uses **Docker Compose** to run both the backend and frontend services in containers.

### üì¶ Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- `.env` files properly configured

### üìÅ Environment Variables

You need to create **two `.env` files** based on the provided examples:

1. **At the root of the project**

   Create a `.env` file from `.env.example`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Inside the `front/` directory**

   Navigate into the `front` folder and copy the example file:

   ```bash
   cd front
   cp .env.example .env
   cd ..
   ```

Make sure all required variables are filled in both files before proceeding.

### üöÄ Start the Application

From the root of the project, run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Docker Compose will:

- Build and start the **backend** service
- Build and start the **frontend** service
- Connect services through a shared Docker network

## Running app locally
### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following software and dependencies installed on your system:

- Node.js: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- MongoDB: [Download and Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- Node Version Manager: [Download and install NVM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone 
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    In project directory
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Add a .env file at root of back-end folder**: <br />
`DICTIONARIES`="learninglanguage_from_pivottongue, secondlearninglanguage_from_another" # Add your dictionaries exactly like this <br />
`NODE_ENV`= "production" or "development" <br />
`SECRET`= 32 characters secret key for jwt signature <br />
`PORT` <br />
`DATABASE`= url connection to your mongo db, required for production <br />

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start mongod
    ```

    Init database:
    ```bash
    node init_database.js
