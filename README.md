# Language course editor

This project is a fork of [Dictionnaire_Participatif](https://github.com/JhanaPF/Dictionnaire_Participatif), a collaborative dictionary.

The dashboard is the course creator.
The api works for both the dashboard and the mobile app.

You can find the mobile app Linguito Lerni [here](https://github.com/JhanaPF/linguito-lerni-flutter).

### üì¶ Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose installed if you just want to run the project
- `.env` files properly configured

### üìÅ Environment Variables

You need to create **two `.env` files** based on the provided examples:

1. **At the root of the project**

   Create a `.env` file from `.env.example`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Inside the `front/` directory**

   Navigate into the `front` folder and copy the example file:

From the root of the project, run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Docker Compose will:

- Build and start the **backend** service
- Build and start the **frontend** service
- Connect services through a shared Docker network

## Running the application locally
